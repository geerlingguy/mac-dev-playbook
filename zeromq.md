Ansible Playbook - ZeroMQ
=========================

An Ansible playbook which installs **ZeroMQ** and all of its dependancies, along with its **Python** binding: **pyzmq**.

These are the files (ZeroMQ and its dependancies) which are retrieved and installed:
	
* **ZeroMQ**
* **autoconf**
* **automake**
* **build-essential**
* **libtool**
* **uuid-dev**
* ***python-pip***
* ***python-dev***
* ***pyzmq***

It's that simple.
