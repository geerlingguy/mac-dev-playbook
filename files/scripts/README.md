# Remaining Todos

Install other brew or MAS-able apps.

# Custom Settings

- Set Mac Fans Controls temperatures
- Caps locks should be set to ESC
- Certain keyboards need alt=>cmd, win=> alt mapping
- Secrets must be managed (.secrets, .aws, .gradle)
	- Keystore must be linked into android/keystores

# Install Licenses

Need to figure out a better process for these. Versus certain other apps that have logins or automatically register, all of these are licenses manually installed from email.

# To Consider

Do I still want to have Hammerspoon? Does it still have a place now that Mac natively can do some remapping (and the most important ones to me?).
